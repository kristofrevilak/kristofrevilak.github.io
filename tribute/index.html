				As an artist and an innovator, he is responsible for <span class="highlight">co-founding the entire Cubist movement</span> alongside Georges Braque. <span class="highlight">Cubism was an avant-garde art movement that changed forever the face of European painting and sculpture </span>while simultaneously affecting contemporary architecture, music and literature. Subjects and objects in Cubism are broken up into pieces and re-arranged in an abstract form. During the period from approximately 1910-1920 when <span class="pablo">Picasso</span> and Braque were laying the foundation for Cubism in France, it's effects were so far-reaching as to inspire offshoots like the styles of Futurism, Dada, and Constructivism in other countries. 			</p>
